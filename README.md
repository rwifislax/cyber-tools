# cyber-tools
Some Useful Tools for Cybersecurity enthusiasts. I built these tools to customize them, and make them better than their alternatives.

# Tools:
- Directory listing
- SSH Bruteforcer
- Port Scanner
- wifi password extracter for Linux (Raspbian 10 tested)

# Features
- Scanner has been proven to scan the 65535 ports of a machine faster than nmap. 
- The directory listing can be modified to find directories that return any HTTP code, like forbidden directories (403), redirections (302), etc.
